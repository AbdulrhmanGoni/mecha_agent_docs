# Onboarding

From here I’ll walk you through creating your first AI Agent chat bot, creating a dataset for it, publishing it, and make it accessible for the people on the internet.

## Create an cccount 🪪

First you need to create a **Mecha Agent** account, Go to the [**Mecha Agent**](https://github.com/AbdulrhmanGoni/mecha_agent_client) App and sign in to create your account and then come back here to continue.

## Creating your first agent 🤖

After you have created your **Mecha Agent** account, Go to `/agents` page and click on **"Create Agent"** button to go to the page where you create your agents, in this page and create your first Agent.

## Creating a dataset for your agent 🗃️

Now after you had your first agent, You need to create a dataset for it because without a dataset the agent is completly useless.

To create a dataset for your Agent, Go to `/datasets` page and 
click on **"Create Dataset"** button to open up the form that you will use to create your datasets.

And now after you have created the dataset, Which is empty initially, You have to add into it some data or instructions 
your agents must follow and only respond to people according to.

## Associate the dataset with your agent 🔗

After creating the dataset and adding some data into it, You need to associate it with your agent.

To associate the dataset with your agent, Go back to `/agents` page and click on the agent that you've created to open it 
in its full page, There you should see "Dataset" section in the bottom and a message telling you that your agent has no 
dataset yet, in that section there should be **"associate with dataset"** button, click on that button to open a popup menu 
you can select from it your dataset to associate it with the agent.

## Publish your agent 🚀

Once you have created your agent, created a dataset for it, added some data into it the dataset, and associated the dataset with your agent, Your agent is now ready to be published !.

To publish your agent go again to `/agents` page and click on your agent to open it in its full page, 
Then you should see **"Publish Agent"** section in the bottom with a button says **"Publish"**, Click on that button and that's it, Your agent is ready to be accessed by anyone on the internet.

The last thing you need is to set up the client interface that the people on the internet can chat with your agent through it,
This client interface is the [**Mecha Agent Inference Client**](/docs/get-started/inference-client.md) which i will cover the next page.
